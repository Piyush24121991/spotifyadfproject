# spotifyadfproject
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end Data Engineering pipeline for extracting, transforming, and analyzing Spotify music data. It showcases how to build scalable, automated, and cloud-based data workflows to generate insights into user preferences, song trends, and artist popularity.
This project is designed to implement a dynamic, incremental, and backdated data pipeline for efficient data transformation and ingestion. The solution leverages parameterization and metadata-driven design to enable flexible data movement between storage layers while supporting historical (backdated) data processing and incremental data loads.

Key features include:

Dynamic Pipeline Design: Enables parameterized execution for multiple datasets and environments.

Incremental Data Loading: Optimized to process only new or updated records, ensuring efficiency.

Backdated Data Handling: Supports reprocessing of historical data as per defined time windows or triggers.

Data Transformation: Performs schema mapping, cleansing, and enrichment as part of the ETL workflow.

Automation Ready: Easily adaptable for CI/CD and orchestrated executions through Azure Data Factory or other orchestration tools.
